# BMICalculator (Production)
This is the code that changed my whole programming experience, which is about calculating BMIs of people

## Description of how it works
It calculates the BMI in two different ways, it uses pounds and kilograms.
While using those two different ways, it requires different types of calculations.
The user needs to select either choice 1 or 2, if its not 1 or 2, an error message displays saying invalid choice,
Meaning that you need to select another choice thats 1 or 2.
After that you can enter your desired amounts then the calculator will calculate for you.
It will generate a report showing what you've entered and show your BMI status
Which may be Underweight, Overweight, Obese etc.
